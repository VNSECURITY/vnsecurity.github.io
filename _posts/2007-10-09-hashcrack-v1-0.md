hashcrack is a fast (as fast as OpenSSL allows) hash cracker. It features an additive hash checking to speed up the process. For example, to check for the hashes of `abc` and `abd`, hashcrack only computes the hash of `ab`, then computes one round each for `c` and `d` totaling 4 rounds (two for `ab`, one for `c` and one for `d`). This eliminates a good number of rounds if we calculate hashes from the beginning (6 in this case). The longer the key, the more the saving.

A draw back to this feature is it does not work with non-additive hash algorithms. Luckily, popular algorithms, such as SHA-1, RIPEMD160, MD5, are additive.

Compared to vshark (another hash cracker by [rd][1]), hashcrack is so much faster. An unscientific benchmark to RIPEMD160-scan the whole 6-character `a-zA-Z0-9` space ended in about 6 minutes with hashcrack, and more than 2 hours with vshark. To be fair to vshark, there was another version of hashcrack written in pure Python. It was 6 times slower than vshark.
