As you may notice that vnsecurity.net server has been taken offline since the beginning of last week for the server upgrade. Our new server has a much better HW specs compare to the old one.

We&#8217;ve also replaced the great Plone/ZODB/Python with the buggy WordPress/Mysql/PHP for our website. I myself really like the Zope Workflow and Zope Object Database with the great fine-grained access control but many members doesn&#8217;t like Plone and it&#8217;s a bit slow especially on a few years old HW with only 1GB RAM (there were 03 Plone&#8217;s instances running for vnsec, vnsecon and vithon.org websites which used all of the 1GB memory).

I don&#8217;t trust PHP & PHP Apps. WordPress/PHP, with a massive number of security bugs in the past, makes me feel unsafe :). Secunia has a good list of <a title="WordPress 2.x Vulnerabilities" href="http://secunia.com/advisories/product/6745/" target="_blank">WordPress 2.x vulnerabilities</a> and 07 bugs are still unpatched.

But on the other side, WP has some really nice plugins and themes which save my time. It&#8217;s like replacing the great & responsible old lady babysitter to a new sexy but &#8220;dangerous&#8221; young college girl. I hope that some additional protection layers and access restriction to the backend would help to save my a$$ from WP&#8217;s bugs.

Cheers!
