Check out this <a href="http://lilysussman.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/im-sorry-but-we-blew-up-your-laptop-welcome-to-israel/" target="_blank">Iâ€™m sorry but we had to blow up your laptop</a> story. Israeli security officers shot through the girl&#8217;s laptop with three bullets because she was suspected due to some of &#8216;suspicious&#8217; pictures in her camera and an arabic phrasebook, a journal entry that mentioned a Palestinian, stamps from Syria, Qatar and the UAE, Palestinians in Palestine guidebook, and a map with a main street in Jerusalem, the central bus station and hostel. They didn&#8217;t shot through the hard disk though .. lol

When I was in Saudi, I have seen an European guy who stayed in the same hotel with my colleague got arrested by a group of police officers in front of me while he was taking picture of stray cats (nearby a govt. building). The guy later said that they searched through his camera and all of his stuffs, deleted all the pics and questioned him for the whole day. Quite scary.
