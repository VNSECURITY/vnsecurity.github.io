### 1. OllyDbg plugin: Catcha! v1.1 – Catcha anywhere

Sometimes you don&#8217;t know how to start a program correctly from OllyDgb. Catcha! plugin will help you to attach to your program automatically as soon as possible each time your program runs (outside OllyDbg).

It works like Olly De-Attach Helper plugin. Catcha! has more advantages than Olly De-Attach Helper. It helps reversers reach the target program EntryPoint by hooking the EntryPoint to a trap function that raises debug exception by INT3 instruction so we can break into that function before attaching and returning to the EntryPoint.
